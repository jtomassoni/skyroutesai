## Issues Found & Fixed

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Fixed)

1. **Unused Variable in API Call**
   - **Location:** `app/page.tsx:42`
   - **Issue:** `apiCall` variable was declared but never used
   - **Fix:** Removed unused variable declaration
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed

2. **SavedSearches Not Refreshing**
   - **Location:** `components/SavedSearches.tsx`
   - **Issue:** Component only loaded searches on mount, didn't refresh when new searches were saved
   - **Fix:** Added custom event listener (`skyroutesai:searchSaved`) to refresh component when searches are saved/deleted
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed

3. **Unsafe Key Generation in FlightResults**
   - **Location:** `components/FlightResults.tsx:53`
   - **Issue:** Key generation could fail if `destinationCode` was undefined
   - **Fix:** Added fallback chain: `destinationCode || destination || 'flight'` and added price to ensure uniqueness
   - **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 🟡 Improvements Made

4. **Enhanced API Error Handling**
   - **Location:** `app/api/search-flights/route.ts`

- ✅ Months ahead slider works (1-6 range)
- ✅ Exclude Basic Economy toggle works

#### LoadingScreen
- ✅ Progress animation works
- ✅ 10-30 second random duration works
- ✅ Ad placeholders display correctly
- ✅ Loading completes and calls `onComplete` callback

#### FlightResults
- ✅ Empty state displays correctly

### ✅ API Testing

#### `/api/search-flights` Route
- ✅ Input validation works
- ✅ Error handling for invalid JSON (improved)
- ✅ Error handling for missing fields
- ✅ Error handling for invalid types
- ✅ Budget range validation (1-100000)
- ✅ Months ahead validation (1-6)
- ✅ Returns proper error responses
- ✅ Returns proper success responses

### ✅ LocalStorage Testing

#### Saved Searches (`lib/localStorage.ts`)
- ✅ Save search works
- ✅ Get saved searches works
- ✅ Delete search works
- ✅ Limits to 20 searches
- ✅ Error handling for quota exceeded (try-catch)

### ✅ Edge Cases Tested

1. **Form Validation**
   - ✅ Empty origin field (HTML5 `required` prevents submission)
   - ✅ Invalid budget (NaN, negative, zero) - handled client-side
   - ✅ Budget > 100000 - validated server-side
   - ✅ Non-integer monthsAhead - range input prevents this

2. **API Edge Cases**
   - ✅ Invalid JSON body - now handled specifically
   - ✅ Missing fields - validated
   - ✅ Wrong types - validated
   - ✅ Empty strings - validated (trimmed)
   - ✅ Very large numbers - validated (max 100000)

3. **LocalStorage Edge Cases**
   - ✅ Quota exceeded - handled with try-catch
   - ✅ Invalid JSON in storage - handled with try-catch
   - ✅ SSR rendering - checks `typeof window`
   - ✅ Multiple saves - limits to 20

4. **UI Edge Cases**
   - ✅ No results - empty state displays
   - ✅ Loading state - loading screen displays
   - ✅ Error state - error message displays
   - ✅ Rapid searches - refs handle race conditions
   - ✅ Missing flight data - fallbacks in place

### ✅ UI/UX Review

#### Desktop
- ✅ Above-the-fold usability
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ Clean, modern design
- ✅ Proper spacing and typography
- ✅ Hover states work
- ✅ Focus states work (accessibility)

#### Mobile

## Remaining Considerations (Non-Critical)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Form Validation Feedback**
   - Currently: Form silently fails if validation fails
   - Future: Could show inline error messages
   - Priority: Low (HTML5 validation provides basic feedback)

2. **Loading State During Rapid Searches**
   - Currently: New search clears previous results immediately
   - Future: Could show "Searching..." indicator
   - Priority: Low (current behavior is acceptable)

3. **LocalStorage Quota Handling**
   - Currently: Errors are caught and logged
   - Future: Could show user-friendly message if quota exceeded
   - Priority: Low (rare edge case)

4. **Budget Input Max Validation**
   - Currently: Max validated server-side only
   - Future: Could add client-side max attribute
   - Priority: Low (server-side validation is sufficient)
